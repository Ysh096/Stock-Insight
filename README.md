# Stock-Insight

This project contains a simple Flask server intended for future Bitcoin auto trading features.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The server will start on port 5000 and expose a basic index route at `/`.
